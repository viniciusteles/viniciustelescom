    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recorded a couple of experimental podcast episodes this week and they worked fine. So, today I&#8217;m officially launching a new podcast. It doesn&#8217;t have a name yet. But I&#8217;ll probably come up with one down the road.</p>

<p>This podcast isn&#8217;t on iTunes yet, but hopefully it will be in the near future. For now, the easiest way to follow is to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ViniciusTelesEN">subscribe to this blog&#8217;s RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>In this first official episode I introduce myself briefly and talk about our decision to not have a house anywhere in the world. Since it&#8217;s kind of a controversial choice, I invite you to listen and think about this theme.</p>

<p>In this episode I mentioned a commencement speech by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> called <strong>This is water</strong>. I heard about it in <a href="http://www.tropicalmba.com/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water">this episode of the TropicalMBA</a>. I highly recommend you to listen to it below. It&#8217;s absolutely great!</p>

    <link href="http://viniciusteles.com/the-ultimate-safety-net"/>
    <updated>2013-03-01T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/the-ultimate-safety-net</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/6311895493_7b9317b6c4_z.jpg" alt="The ultimate safety net" />Photo from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rainchurch/6311895493/">Flickr</a> (CC).</p>
<p>Everybody wants to have a safety net, right? That&#8217;s why we try to save some money for the rainy days. But are things like money, property, stocks or the likes real safety nets? I mean, what&#8217;s the ultimate safety net after all?</p>
<p>This subject is important to me because I value freedom. Fortunately, I&#8217;m pretty much free to do whatever I want currently. That&#8217;s because I have a steady income and enough resources to support my life needs and I don&#8217;t have a job that forces me to be confined to an office during arbitrary hours of my day.</p>
<p>As much as I like it this way, truth is that it could all change suddenly. The business might get into trouble, as much as the market can change and turn things in the wrong direction. What could be done, then?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have a financial cushion, I can maintain my freedom, at least for a while, even during troubled times. The thicker the cushion, the longer I can sustain my freedom. But let&#8217;s face it, there&#8217;s only so much time you can buy if you&#8217;re not making money for some reason.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not even the worst case scenario. The whole financial cushion might vanish unexpectedly for a variety of reasons. This happened so many times in history, with so many people, that we shouldn&#8217;t even have to remember that. Take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2008 financial crisis</a> for instance, just to mention one event that destroyed so many personal savings.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s important to have some financial reserve for the rainy days. But I don&#8217;t thing we should rely exclusively on that. In fact, I believe this shouldn&#8217;t be our safety net at all. It&#8217;s just a very important short term protection mechanism. But there are times when it&#8217;s just not enough.</p>
<p>In times of <a href="http://mawaheb-sa.blogspot.com/2013/02/going-out-of-syria.html">war</a>, for instance, money can erode fast and can&#8217;t necessarily buy you a way out of the madness. So, again, what should we rely on?</p>
<p>Thinking about that, I came to the conclusion that skills and relationships, together, act as the best safety net available. &nbsp;The more you develop these, the safer you are in the long term, no matter what happens around you.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, that you&#8217;ve created a company and managed to make it very successful. What does it happen if you loose everything? You might be devastated for a while, but eventually you&#8217;ll realize that you can do it all over again. And it&#8217;ll probably be easier than before.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because you&#8217;ve developed skills and relationships. They will help you to get out of the problem and build a solution. And you&#8217;ll know people that can help you along the way. Even in times of <a href="http://mawaheb-sa.blogspot.com/2013/02/going-out-of-syria.html">war</a>, if you have skills and you know some people around, your chances of escaping increase significantly.</p>
<p>Now compare that with a couch potato that has a lot of money in the bank, few skills and few relationships. In difficult times, if he loses everything, how does he get out of the trouble? Without skills and without friends, things are tough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lucky, cause I&#8217;m Brazilian. In Brazil we don&#8217;t have <a href="http://mawaheb-sa.blogspot.com/2013/02/going-out-of-syria.html">war</a> but we&#8217;ve been in crisis since forever. Oh, actually, we&#8217;ve had some better moments lately, but how long will they last?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this country go through so many financial crisis that I&#8217;ve lost track of them. They&#8217;re just routine. This is good in a way: people paying attention can learn from that. They learn not to trust the government, banks, companies or whatever. They learn to trust on themselves and their relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me share an example of the madness I&#8217;ve seen in Brazil. In 1990 a new president came and decided it was time to kill inflation once and for all. How? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plano_Collor">Freeze all of the accounts</a> for one and a half year. People are allowed to withdraw up to 1,500 monetary units once and that&#8217;s it. Want the rest? Wait one and a half year.</p>
<p>Want to kill the inflation? Easy, kill the economy itself and inflation won&#8217;t be a problem anymore. It worked. Inflation was over along with so many companies, jobs and lives. Many people killed themselves after realizing they couldn&#8217;t find a way out of that mess.</p>
<p>This story is rather drastic. It happened just over twenty years ago and it shows how incompetent Brazilian governments can be. But, they&#8217;re not alone. Ten years later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corralito">Argentina followed Brazil&#8217;s steps</a> and did the same with disastrous consequences. The country still didn&#8217;t recover from that. And, of course, I don&#8217;t have to mention the general stupidity of developed nations so well exemplified by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2008 financial crisis</a> (and others before), which was so catastrophic that makes Brazilian and Argentinian governments look smart actually.</p>
<p>Stories like that happen suddenly. Sometimes there are warnings. Other times it can&#8217;t be foreseen at all, like in the case of natural disasters. So, what can we do? I think we should always be prepared.</p>
<p>Firstly because we&#8217;ll probably be better off during bad times. But also because it&#8217;s much more interesting to live a life where we&#8217;re always learning and improving our skills. And, of course, making friends and nurturing relationships is a lot of fun and quite rewarding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you, what do you thing? Is there a better safety net?</p>

    <link href="http://viniciusteles.com/startup-problems"/>
    <updated>2013-02-20T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/startup-problems</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/527304360_2852ed007b_z.jpeg" alt="Startup problems" /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Photo:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/527304360/">Gisela Giardino</a> (CC)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes it hard to create a successful startup? In my opinion, skills or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m a software developer, I created a software company and eventually a <a href="http://beonthe.net">product</a>. But, being a software guy makes me ready to run a software company? Well, not really.</p>
<p>I believe the success or failure of a company has little to do with what founders can do well. What really matters is what they can&#8217;t yet do well. It&#8217;s all that lies <strong>out of the comfort zone</strong>.</p>
<p>As a software developer, I can perform several technical tasks well enough to have a <a href="http://beonthe.net">product</a> running for years with little need for any kind of technical maintenance. That&#8217;s great. But it&#8217;s far from enough.</p>
<p>There are many important areas that I&#8217;m not so skilled at. They represent a sort of discomfort zone to me. Because of that, I naturally tend to dedicate my time on tasks that are more technical in nature just because they&#8217;re in my comfort zone.</p>
<p>For instance, marketing is one of the most critical parts of the business. But, it&#8217;s far from my comfort zone. This gives me an infinite number of <strong>excuses</strong> to turn to other more &#8220;prioritary&#8221; technical tasks. That&#8217;s totally wrong and only recently I understood it completely.</p>
<p>Now, if I find myself doing something comfortable, I know for sure that I&#8217;m probably dedicating my time to the wrong activity. There&#8217;s so much that I need to learn and train in other areas of the business, that there&#8217;s little time, if any, to spend in the comfort zone.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of willpower to push ourselves out of the comfort zone with daily actions. Exactly because those actions will have to be so uncomfortable until every important area of the business become well understood and well addressed.</p>
<p>This year, for instance, I&#8217;ve decided that I should spend most of my time communicating and doing marketing. That&#8217;s something that I overlooked for too long. Time to take care of it.</p>
<p>Comunicating is hard. But if I can&#8217;t get my message accross, people won&#8217;t know about <a href="http://beonthe.net">my product</a>, no matter how wonderful I believe it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about you? What&#8217;s your discomfort zone?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/fu.jpg" alt="Why services are so bad in Brazil and why we need the start ups" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">CC by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thoth-god/3680655443/">Thoth, God of Knowledge</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been passionate about entrepreneurship. That&#8217;s why I became very enthusiastic about the growing interest for start ups in Brazil. But something began to bother me about it. I couldn&#8217;t fully understand the mixed feelings until recently.</p>
<p><strong>Some background</strong></p>
<p>Traveling around the world has helped me to understand Brazil as much as the world itself. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about my home country staying away from it. An interesting paradox, which might be explained by the new perspective that I gained being abroad.</p>
<p>One important lesson about the world: there&#8217;s no perfect country anywhere. There are very serious problems wherever you go. But, it&#8217;s also true that in some countries people live better than in others.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Brazil is in a very bad position. It&#8217;s not great. But it&#8217;s much better than we probably think. Anyway, there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement specially when it comes to products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Brazilian products and services</strong></p>
<p>It makes me really sad to write that, but I think products and services in Brazil are among the worst in the world, although they&#8217;re also, strangely enough, among the most expensive. And let me be very specific about this. I&#8217;m not only comparing Brazil to the rich countries. I&#8217;m talking about the more than forty countries I&#8217;ve visited which range from poor to very rich countries.</p>
<p>We, Brazilians, complain all of the time about the cable company, the telephone company, the electricity company, the government, the bank, the shops, the hospitals, the roads, the schools, you name it. Are they all that bad? Yes, they generally are. And if you spend some time away from Brazil, them you realize that they really are very bad indeed. But also extremely expensive. Which means that we&#8217;re being ripped off most of the time in Brazil. That&#8217;s my feeling, at least, when I&#8217;m in Brazil.</p>
<p>Are these things perfect in other parts of the world? No, they&#8217;re not. But, on average, I&#8217;d say they tend to be better and less expensive. We really pay a lot in Brazil for very shitty products and quite horrific services, in general. But why?</p>
<p><strong>Some possible causes</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the exact reasons, but I have some gut feelings about it. As Brazilians we might not realize completely how populated our country is. There are almost 200 million people in Brazil. Only four other countries are more populated: China, India, the USA and Indonesia. We have in Brazil half of the population of South America. It&#8217;s a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have a very low unemployment rate now. The average last year was 5.5%. Actually, in December 2012, it was 4.6%. It&#8217;s quite low, specially for a country as big and as populated as Brazil. Just for the sake of comparison: Canada 7.4%, USA 7.7%, UK 7.7%, Finland 7.9%, Sweden 8.1%, France 10.7%, Ireland 14.7%, Portugal 15.8%, Greece 26% and Spain 26%.</p>
<p>If a country has a large population and almost everybody is working, that means there&#8217;s a lot of demand for products and services and people can actually pay for it. Which is all good news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also means that people will probably buy stuff whether they&#8217;re good or not. I mean, if there&#8217;s such a high demand in the market, then you don&#8217;t need to work that hard to make good products and render good services. The very basic will probably be good enough. And that&#8217;s precisely what happens in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter that much if you do it well or not. You&#8217;ll probably sell anyway. Just because there&#8217;s so much need and so many people that can buy. And it gets worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at education. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t matter which figures you look at. When it comes to education, Brazil is a tragedy. It&#8217;s that simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do people go to school? Yes. But the quality of education is generally lacking. So, most Brazilians can read and write in theory. But only barely. There&#8217;s a relatively small group (compared to the size of the population) that is extremely well educated. But the majority of the people has a very basic education level. Now that&#8217;s a huge problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If most people is poorly educated and almost everybody is working, that means most of the working people is poorly educated. So, it&#8217;s almost natural that we all get bad products and bad services in return. Because to have good products and great services, we&#8217;ve got to improve the general education level. And we all know how &nbsp;imperative it is to improve education in Brazil. But, there&#8217;s something else.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, there&#8217;s a relatively small group of very well educated people in Brazil. A group that is running companies as directors, managers, company owners, technicians and the likes.</p>
<p>Since they tend to be on the top of the corporate hierarchy, they are the ones making the rules. So they&#8217;re actually the most important people when it comes to producing good products and rendering great services. Because they set the direction of the companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they decide companies should invest more in producing high quality products, or invest more in the education of their workforce, then, this will be done. Because they are the guys who have the power to change companies for the better. These guys are really important. If we want better products and better services, we need to make these guys embrace this goal and understand that more money will follow naturally as a result.</p>
<p>Problem is, this is not going to happen. The guys I&#8217;m talking about are actually very well educated corporate jerks. They have the education and the skills, but they don&#8217;t have high moral standards. The guys running the big companies, the managers, the directors, are just too busy making money easily offering shitty stuff and ridiculously bad service. There&#8217;s a sea of people to buy anyway, whether it&#8217;s high quality or not. So, why care about it? Sorry, but I have no hope for these companies. They&#8217;re already too messed up. It&#8217;s a pity.</p>
<p><strong>The Start ups</strong></p>
<p>Every year there&#8217;s a new wave of well educated people coming to the Brazilian market after university. It&#8217;s not a lot of people, compared to the size of the population, but it&#8217;s a very important group. Because it&#8217;s the group that has the greatest potential to change things for the better, in my opinion. Because they can start fresh. They don&#8217;t have to carry the burden of the past.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these guys decide to take exams to work for the government. So we lose lots of talents in the process. Some of them are helping the government to become a little bit better. But, in my opinion, the waste is huge.</p>
<p>Others will go to work at one of those big companies and they&#8217;ll become part of the corporate world of companies that couldn&#8217;t care less for their customers. Another waste.</p>
<p>A few will go to work at some few really nice companies that are trying to make a difference. And a tiny group of people will decide to become entrepreneurs. They will, eventually, create some kind of start up. That&#8217;s great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This last group is extremely important. Because it can bring significant change to the market over time. It&#8217;s such a tiny group with such a huge chance to impact our society for the better, that it&#8217;s really important that they choose their path carefully.</p>
<p>The way I see it, and I might be very wrong, the Brazilian start up movement, if we can call it this way, very often tries to follow the steps of what happens in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s all this focus on trying to create a new concept, testing it, getting out of the building, finding a market fit, getting funding and all of that. In other words, there&#8217;s a great focus on trying to come up with new ideas, new concepts. Innovation is king, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not. It&#8217;s really cool when something like <a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is created. But let&#8217;s face it. It&#8217;s also very rare. And it&#8217;s quite hard to innovate and turn the innovation into a great business. So, I say maybe we&#8217;ve been putting too much attention into innovation, when in places like Brazil, that&#8217;s hardly the most critical issue.</p>
<p>In Brazil companies, with some very respectable exceptions, generally don&#8217;t do the basics well. They&#8217;re doing it really wrong, whether they&#8217;re producing products or rendering services. So, what we need desperately, to begin with, is a bunch of companies that at the very least cover the basics correctly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the most ordinary types of companies, like restaurants, drugstores, supermarkets, bakeries, shoe shops, fitness centers, you name it. Every sector of our economy can benefit of more of these &#8220;ordinary&#8221; companies that just cover the basics appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in Niteroi, where I used to live, there are several restaurants. But if you ask me: how many good restaurants do you know there? I say two. Only two. How many good coffee shops? One! In many sectors, I might answer none. Because I really don&#8217;t know one good example. We have several that are below ok. But very few that are good. And I don&#8217;t even bother to expect one excellent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really cool to have start ups coming up with new ideas. But seriously, there are many kinds of businesses that are very well known and terribly run in Brazil. If someone decides to create a company to run one of these &#8220;ordinary&#8221; businesses, but do it really well, I can guarantee you two things: it will make a good money and it will help Brazil to become a better place. We desperately need more of these ordinary businesses well managed.</p>
<p>Good thing about it is that since those ordinary businesses have been around for such a long time, there&#8217;s no need to invent a lot. And even better, one can always fly to some part of the world where we can find some very good examples.</p>
<p>Want to create a coffee shop? Fly to Buenos Aires and hop from one coffee shop to the other. You&#8217;ll have lots of great ideas. Want to see how to render the best service in the world, spend some time in Japan. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Innovation is cool. But we, Brazilians, desperately need some new ordinary businesses that really care for the customer. We can do it. And if we do it, money will come. Trust me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conversation took place several times in the last few days:</p>
<p>- So, how long are you staying in Istanbul.</p>
<p>- Two month.</p>
<p>- Wow, two months! Why? What are you doing in here? Work or something?</p>
<p>- Actually, it&#8217;s kind of complicated. We don&#8217;t have a house anywhere in the world. We keep traveling from one place to the other. This time we chose to spend two months in Istanbul and we&#8217;re mostly working remotely for our businesses in Brazil.</p>
<p>- How cool is that? But what do you do?</p>
<p>- I&#8217;m a software developer. I just need my notebook and an internet connection, so it doesn&#8217;t matter where I am in the world.</p>
<p>- Wow, what a privilege! I&#8217;m so jealous of you. Your profession is really great cause you can work from anywhere. That&#8217;s amazing. And where do you go next?</p>
<p>- I still don&#8217;t know. We haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings every time this conversation strikes. It&#8217;s good to be reminded of the privilege I have as a software developer to work from anywhere in the world. It&#8217;s not good to be reminded that many others have the same privilege but waste it somehow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many software developers out there. Just a few understand this privilege and actually take action on it. Why? Pay attention to the two stories below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Renato: the conventional guy</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me describe a scenario that happens often in Brazil, cause it&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m most familiarized with, but I suspect it isn&#8217;t that different from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renato is a guy who just got accepted at a good public university. He doesn&#8217;t have to pay for his education and he&#8217;ll be spending the next four years on a computer science course.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year internship offers begin to arrive. Soon he&#8217;s working part time on some company and earning a very reasonable salary, for a student. It doesn&#8217;t take long for him to come up with a brilliant idea: buying a car. He saves enough for the down payment and purchases what might not be a Ferrari, but is a respectable machine.</p>
<p>University is over and Renato is hired at one of the many companies desperately in need of a software developer. He&#8217;s still in the beginning of his career, but now he has a very decent salary for someone at the bottom of the corporate ladder. An inevitable idea strikes him: I should probably buy my own place. After all, what else is more important than owning a house?</p>
<p>He saves enough for the down payment and buys a house, which doesn&#8217;t really goes well with the old car. So he switches to a brand new one using the previous as down payment. Now he has two debts that will eat most of his salary for many years to come. But that&#8217;s fine, because his salary will increase soon enough. He&#8217;ll work his way out of programming, cause programming is kind of an entry level activity, so he thinks. He wants to become some sort of technical leader, business analyst or eventually a manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is better now, not only because of his shiny car and place, but also because he met the girl of his life. They date for a while and eventually decide to get married. Of course there has to be a wedding. Which means some serious expenses on the horizon.</p>
<p>Now Renato is married. He takes care of the payments of the car, the house and some wedding services that are being paid in installments. The moment he and his wife comes back from the honey moon is celebrated among the family with pestering questions on a very sure and specific topic: when will the baby come? A couple needs a baby for sure. At least one for starters.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been married for a couple of years now and his baby is about to born. No problem, cause at this point Renato is not a programmer anymore. He&#8217;s making more money working on a managerial position. He fires emails, elaborates spreadsheets and files reports like no other. Great use of his time at the public university indeed.</p>
<p>Renato still has a few more years to become thirty. And at this point he&#8217;s anything but free. He&#8217;s bright, well educated, makes a lot of money but can&#8217;t afford to change his life in any direction because he has too many responsibilities and lots of strings attached.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Silvio: the crazy guy</strong></span></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at one of Renato&#8217;s classmates. His name is Silvio and he lives with his family when he starts the computer science course. Same as Renato, actually.</p>
<p>In the first week at the university, Silvio, Renato and a few other colleagues are having lunch when they hear about <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a> for the first time. Renato doesn&#8217;t give it too much attention. Silvio, on the other hand, decides to investigate it further. He learns, among other things, that many people host foreign travelers in order to improve their English conversation. Actually he needs to improve his own English skills, so he checks with his parents if it would be ok to share the apartment&#8217;s couch with some foreigners. Fortunately, he gets green light.</p>
<p>Silvio receives his first guest from Toronto, Canada, few days later and realizes how poor his English skills are. But things go well. After a few days, he&#8217;s more confident speaking in English with his guest. He feels like he&#8217;s learned much more than in the six years he spent on a private English course.</p>
<p>Life goes on and he hosts several other people, always struggling to balance the time he spends with the guests and the time he needs to study for the university. Good thing is that this arrangement proved to be so challenging that he had to learn fast to focus and prioritize. And since his English skills improved so fast in a few months, he manages to find an internship position even earlier than Renato. Six months earlier to be more specific.</p>
<p>By the end of the first year at the university, Silvio has hosted dozens of people and most of them invited him to visit them in their hometown. &nbsp;Silvio makes a good money from the internship, but he saves most of it. Since he lives with his parents, he figures out that there&#8217;s no hurry to spend the money, and it&#8217;s always a good idea to have some cash saved for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Jorge is an Argentinian guest that became very close to Silvio. He insists that Silvio come to visit him during his vacations from the university. The flight ticket is not that expensive. So Silvio figures out that he can buy it without hurting his savings too badly. And since he&#8217;ll stay at Jorge&#8217;s place, for free, he decides to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He falls in love with Argentina and begin to learn Spanish with Jorge and his friends. One of them is also a software developer and he&#8217;s involved in this cool open source software project. Silvio can&#8217;t really program that well yet, but he is invited for the project and gets really enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>Back home, Silvio keeps studying, hosting travelers and working. But he has a better internship position now, thanks to the skills he&#8217;s been developing while he works in the open source project, and his ability to both speak English fluently and some Spanish. He makes even more money than before, but he keeps saving, most of the time. He doesn&#8217;t have a car, but he doesn&#8217;t have a debt either.</p>
<p>When the university comes to an end Silvio has already traveled to over thirty different countries. Most of the time visiting people he hosted before. He has lots of friends all over the globe. Not only because of <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a>, but also thanks to the work he&#8217;s been doing on some open source projects.</p>
<p>In fact, precisely because of this work, he&#8217;s now receiving offers from many companies and some of them pay really well. He chooses one and go for it. It&#8217;s kind of far from his home, it will take him a lot of time commuting, but the work seems to be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Few months latter he&#8217;s really sick of the commuting. And at this point he feels like it&#8217;s about time to move out of his parents house. So he finds this small apartment close to his work. He has a very good salary and already has substantial savings for a nineteen year old kid. Which is kind of funny if you think that he already traveled to so many countries. But always on the cheap, thanks to his friends.</p>
<p>He rents the small flat and makes sure to have a couch to keep hosting travelers. Since it&#8217;s just five minutes away from his work, there&#8217;s no need to have a car. Sometimes he likes to travel by car to places not too far away, so he rents a car only for the necessary period, since this is much cheaper than actually owning a car.</p>
<p>Two years later he get&#8217;s this incredible job offer. But unfortunately in a place too far away, on the other side of the city. After some thought he realizes he can just move to another apartment, closer to the new workplace. Since he doesn&#8217;t own his current apartment, he doesn&#8217;t have any debt nor any kind of attachments to it, he&#8217;s free to move out in no time.</p>
<p>Few years goes by and he keeps traveling a lot and enjoying the <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/travel-with-local-guide.html">help and hospitality of local people</a>, always using a bit of his savings and saving even more staying with one of the many friends spread over the globe. And because he&#8217;s a software developer, a programmer that only gets better over time, he&#8217;s really respected in his company. So his boss is very accommodating when he wants to travel for a longer period of time and asks to do his work remotely.</p>
<p>One day he&#8217;s traveling in South Korea when he meets Daniela, the girl of his life. She&#8217;s a Brazilian fashion designer spending her vacations in South Korea and Japan, both paradises for fashion designers. Inspirations everywhere.</p>
<p>It turns out that Daniela is not only Brazilian. She actually comes from the exact city where Silvio lives, but they&#8217;ve never met there. How crazy is life? They met for the first time thousands of miles away from their hometown. They eventually begin to date as soon as they come back to Brazil.</p>
<p>A while later they decide to get married. But since both love to travel, they prefer to save money for that and actually avoid high expenses from a wedding. So they organized a nice wedding, but nothing too big nor too fancy. Most importantly, they don&#8217;t want to have any kind of debt after the wedding.</p>
<p>By the way, they still don&#8217;t want to own a house and go into any kind of debt. So they rent another apartment, halfway to his and her job. It&#8217;s not fancy nor big, but it&#8217;s cozy and they like it.</p>
<p>Sometimes they travel together for longer periods and she also manages to convince her boss to work remotely in these occasions, which after a while became more and more frequent. Until a moment when both convinced their respective bosses that it would be just more productive to work from home.</p>
<p>They begin to work from home and spend much more time together. But now they ran out of excuses. When friends from other countries invite them for a visit, they can&#8217;t say anymore that they won&#8217;t be going because of work. Everyone knows they can work from anywhere. Poor guys, next thing you know they&#8217;re traveling the world full time, cause it really doesn&#8217;t matter where they are. They can still work and live a perfectly wonderful life hoping from country to country. They even decide to not have any house, anywhere in the world. And they move around sometimes using <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a>, other times using <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=283vz9905czz5">Airbnb to find affordable accommodation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven years after the wedding they decide to have a kid. They think it&#8217;s a good idea to come back to Brazil for a while and so they do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is different now. They rent a big enough apartment and don&#8217;t travel all the time anymore. Specially in the first months of the new born. But it doesn&#8217;t take long for the baby to join the party and begin to travel with them. After all, there are friends all over the world longing to meet little Lucas.</p>
<p>When it comes to buying a house, Silvio and Daniela didn&#8217;t make up their minds yet. They don&#8217;t even know where they&#8217;d like to spend the rest of their lives. But that&#8217;s ok, by the time they decide it their savings will be more than enough to buy a house at sight with a good discount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, they&#8217;re free to do be wherever they want, whenever they want, and still get their job done. How cool is that?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Freedom to choose what to do with your own time</strong></span></p>
<p>Money is quite obvious. Everybody works for it. But time is what really matters, cause you can always make more money, but you can never get back the time that past. So I&#8217;d claim that one of the most important things in life is freedom to use time however you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>There are many ways to achieve this freedom, specially if you are a software developer. You only need to pay attention at the decisions along the way. Also because life is too short to not pay attention.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s going to be your story? Conventional? Crazy? Start paying attention.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-07T00:00:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/couch-surfing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know that moment when you realize how stupid you&#8217;ve been? That&#8217;s the feeling I&#8217;ve had for the last two days. Let me explain.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been traveling around the world for more than two years now and I&#8217;ve always complained that I wanted an easy way to meet people wherever we go. Because meeting locals or other fellow travelers is always the best part of the journey. But how can someone arrive in a new city and connect with people?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually pretty easy and the solution has always been on the tip of my fingers. I just haven&#8217;t tried it before, until yesterday. And I guess many of you probably know that I&#8217;m talking about <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> is a web site created more than a decade ago. Say you&#8217;ve got a couch on your living room and you&#8217;d like to host a traveler. You go to <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">http://www.couchsurfing.org</a>, create a profile, tell the world that you have this awesome couch and soon enough people begin to ask you for a chance to stay at your place for a few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You offer your couch, spare bed, room, or whatever as a courtesy. You can&#8217;t charge for it on <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a>. On the other hand, if you travel using <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a>, you eventually stay in other person&#8217;s place paying nothing for it. But you are generally more than welcome to show your appreciation with a gift, or teaching something from your country, like cooking a regional meal, for instance.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s super cool, right? But there&#8217;s more. Couch Surfers organize lots of activities all year round. And everybody is welcome. Even people that never used <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> to travel, or to host, can participate. For instance, there are weekly meet ups in many cities. And that&#8217;s how we finally joined <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a>.</p>
<p>In Istanbul, there are lots of weekly meet ups. There was one last night hosted in a bar basicly to socialize. There was another one tonight for English conversation. We&#8217;ve been to both and it was an amazing experience. How could we miss it for such a long time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth is that I knew about <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a> for a while. But everytime I tried to use it, I got frustrated and kind of intimidated by the user interface. It&#8217;s pretty confusing. I could never really overcome this barrier until this week. I told myself: you&#8217;ve got to try harder cause there&#8217;s something great out there and you&#8217;re missing it. And that turns out to be absolutely true.</p>
<p>There were 30+ people last night and 40+ people tonight. Most of then are Turkish. So, those were just perfect places to meet local people as well as people from different origins that are living in Istanbul. But why were there so many people?</p>
<p>I learnt yesterday that traveling abroad is not easy for the Turkish. Aparently, they have to apply for a visa for most of the countries they&#8217;d like to visit (fortunately they don&#8217;t need a visa for Brazil). Anyway, many people just can&#8217;t afford the trip. And learning English at school doesn&#8217;t really work. English teaching is generally very poor in Turkey. Same thing in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But here some people really want to learn English. And since most of them probably can&#8217;t afford to pay for a private English course, they like to attend meet ups to practice English with the foreigners that are visiting Istanbul. Which is absolutely wonderful for everybody.</p>
<p>So they have those meetings every week and they are always packed with people. Pay attention to this important detail. Tonight is Saturday night! They meet to practice English on a Saturday night! That&#8217;s really nice.</p>
<p>Patricia and I talked to many people tonight. Most of them were Turkish indeed. But we also met people from Algeria, Canada, Armenia, Romania, Germany, Brazil, Bolivia, Syria and Luxemburg. And we learnt a bit about each of these places. As a matter of fact, I even learnt to play backgammon! And I won. Talk about beginers luck. :-)</p>
<p>I deeply regret all the time I wasted not trying to use <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.org">Couch Surfing</a>. But I&#8217;m delighted that we&#8217;ve finally began to use it. And Istanbul seems to be just the perfect place, since people really use it a lot and it works incredbly well.</p>

    <link href="http://viniciusteles.com/digital-nomad-effects-on-productivity"/>
    <updated>2012-11-22T00:00:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/digital-nomad-effects-on-productivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">digital nomads</a> a couple of years ago. We&#8217;ve been to dozens of cities and countries along the way. But it&#8217;s not only leisure. As a matter of fact, we&#8217;re working most of the time, regardless of our current location.</p>
<p />
<div>Working as we travel is quite challenging. But only recently I realized that it&#8217;s essentially as challenging as before. Not worse. Nor better. Basically the same problem. Kind of counterintuitive, right?</div>
<p />
<div>When I had a home and a fancy home office, I struggled to get work done. I worked a lot and I was always busy. But producing meaningful results and getting close to achieving my goals was an entirely different story. It&#8217;s easier to be busy than to make progress.</div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;ve always had many to do lists, each one with zillions of entries. So many things in fact, that it&#8217;s hard to choose from. What&#8217;s the most meaningful tasks to accomplish today? This week? This month?</div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;d eventually choose one, but my days would go filled with all sorts of distractions. By the way, distractions are so plentiful and so addictive these days, that it&#8217;s hard to believe we can ever ship anything at all. I&#8217;ve got to admit that email, Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, the news website, just to mention a few, are a drag. I try to fight them as much as possible, but they keep coming back and sucking the life out of me. And it could be worse. I don&#8217;t watch TV at all. What if I did?</div>
<p />
<div>When I was at my home office, other mundane distractions took a lot of my time too. Some things really needed to be done and would take time that I&#8217;d rather put in my work. But many others could be completely avoided.</div>
<p />
<div>While traveling I noticed that the pattern has changed but the results were the same. Instead of dealing with trivial distractions, I have to act on some serious topics every day. Like, where are we going to spend the night? How do we move from the airport to our temporary apartment when we get to this new city tomorrow? By the way, where is the best place to stay in this city? Which country are we going to visit next month?&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>When it comes to traveling,&nbsp;<a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I have very clear responsibilities. She takes the pictures, I organize the trip. So I really have to research and decide on a wide variety of topics almost every day. It&#8217;s a lot of work and it takes time.</div>
<p />
<div>So, as before, I can&#8217;t be as productive on my work as I wish. It used to be caused by trivial distractions. Now it&#8217;s caused by some seriously basic needs. But as far work productivity is concerned, the end result is still the same: I get much less done than I&#8217;d like to admit.</div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about this lately and I have a theory. I believe there&#8217;s a way to solve this problem and have more work done using a somewhat counterintuitive idea. What if I&#8217;d choose to dedicate my workday to execute <strong>one and only one task</strong> and actually finish it in one day, no matter what happens during the day?&nbsp;</div>

    <updated>2012-04-03T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/malaysia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pati and I spent the last week in Malaysia. I have to confess that this wasn&#8217;t exactly the plan. The idea was to spend a couple of days in Kuala Lumpur and them move on to Singapore. But unfortunately we had to cancel our trip to Singapore and spent the whole week in Kuala Lumpur. <p /> Malaysia is one of those places that doesn&#8217;t receive enough love from travelers. People often spend a short time there if they go there at all. We didn&#8217;t plan to spend a lot of time there either but we were kind of forced to stay longer. We didn&#8217;t do any tourism at all and we spent most of our time in the hotel, working on our notebooks. So I can&#8217;t say anything about Kuala Lumpur from a touristic perspective. But I &#8220;lived&#8221; a normal life there for a week and I had a chance to meet several Malaysians in the process. <br />After that, I have to say that people were generally very friendly and I enjoyed my stay in KL. The city has the traffic problems of the big cities, but it felt much less so than other places we visited before in Asia. Maybe that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s just less people in KL than other big cities we visited previously in Asia. <br />Again, I don&#8217;t know how interesting KL is for tourism. But I found it to be quite convenient for someone who needs to work remotely. It&#8217;s not hard to find good and affordable accommodation and many services that I used were efficient. <br />All in all it was a different week in our trip, but I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to come back in the future if I were just looking for a convenient location to spend some time working remotely. <p /> PS: now we&#8217;re in Honk Kong and we&#8217;ll be visiting many other interesting places soon, besides Hong Kong itself which is a very impressive city.</p>

    <link href="http://viniciusteles.com/autonomy-is-so-underrated"/>
    <updated>2012-03-29T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/autonomy-is-so-underrated</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Choose your goals wisely because you may actually get what you want! You better aim at something meaningful. <p /> Most people seem to want at least one thing in common: more money. The thinking is that if you have more money, than you can have more stuff and do more stuff. And this somehow translates into being happier. <p /> Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. Money is a very important tool and as such, having it can be quite helpful. So it makes sense to try to have at least enough money to do what you want. Having more won&#8217;t hurt, though. On the other hand, there&#8217;s only so much you can do if you can&#8217;t control your own time. <br />As it turns out, time and autonomy to use your time as you wish is far more meaningful and life changing than only having money. Having more and more money but no time and autonomy to use it is not particularly meaningful and it&#8217;s a waste in itself. <p /> Pati and I travel around the world permanently not because we have a lot of money. Actually, we probably earn less than most people we know with equivalent qualifications. We do travel because we have autonomy over our time and we use whatever money we have carefully. <p /> It took us a while and some serious focus to achieve this level of autonomy. But most of all, it required an understanding of what we should focus on: autonomy and freedom. Unfortunately, they&#8217;re so underrated.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: to my friends in the technology field I must add that software developers are probably some of the most priviledged people when it comes to achieving a great deal of autonomy, as long as they aim at it, of course. Fortunately, one can write software wherever and whenever they want to. A humble taxi driver reminded me of that a few days ago, here in Kuala Lumpur. ;-)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since the last post. That&#8217;s because I made a mistake. I wrote the first articles with a lot of care and illustrated them with some amazing pictures from Pati. I can do this once in a while, but I just can&#8217;t do this every day. It would be just too much work. <p /> So I&#8217;m just writing today to take the pressure off. From now on I&#8217;ll make a daily effort to write a little bit about our journey. Just enough to update you. I think it&#8217;s going to be better to have several small posts over time than a few elaborated ones that are seldom published. <p /> Since my last writing, when we were in Australia, we visited several places. We went to New Zealand, Japan, India and Thailand. At this moment we&#8217;re in Malaysia. Both Japan and Thailand are places that we plan to come back often from now on. We loved them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exactly one year ago&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I left Brazil to begin a new life in another country: our beloved Argentina. At least that was the plan, but what actually happened was something else that we could never anticipate.</p>
<div><br />
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_0483.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>The idea</strong></div>
<p />
<div>In 2009, after a lovely trip to Buenos Aires I had this &#8220;crazy&#8221; idea: what if we moved to Buenos Aires? I suggested that to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and she happily agreed that this would be really cool. The only problem is that this couldn&#8217;t happen any time soon.</div>
<p />
<div>You see,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;is a renowned&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">wedding photographer in Brazil</a>. So, although it was still 2009, she was already heavily booked for 2010. Meaning she would be taking pictures of weddings almost every weekend during 2010. So, the only thing we could do was to push the move to the end of 2010. And so we did it.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/blog_madrid_0020.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC0103.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC0061.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Experiments</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, by that time, she still had some room in the first months of the year. So we managed to squeeze a trip around the USA in the beginning of 2010. &nbsp;That gave us an opportunity to experiment with remote working.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;works with Karol and I work with Leandro. They would both stay in Brazil during this USA trip and we&#8217;d be forced to work with them remotely.</div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, everything went well and we found the confidence to go on with our plans. So&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;worked her schedule of 2011 in a way that would allow less weddings and more time between each of them. This way, we&#8217;d be able to move to Argentina but still come back to Rio from time to time, so that she could take picture of weddings there. In my case, since my work could be accomplished remotely, I&#8217;d be just fine anywhere as long as there would be internet connection available.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC7657.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama1.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama2.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div><strong>The preparation</strong></div>
<p />
<div>The last months of 2010 were just crazy as we tried to prepare for the move. The major effort was to sell everything we had and clear the apartment. This proved to be a much harder endeavor than we could possibly anticipate. A kind of story that deserves many posts apart.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2755.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2750.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>The beginning</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, on the 30th of December of 2010 we flew to Argentina. And just a couple of hours later we began to drive two thousand kilometers in order to arrive in beautiful Bariloche, just in time for New Years Eve. We arrived there exactly at 23:30h on the following day with no booking in any hotel. Yes, you can call me crazy. :-) But with the never ending list of pre-trip tasks, I couldn&#8217;t take care of this. I was barely able to book a car rental.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, after asking in different hotels with no luck we managed to find a nice place to stay. And that&#8217;s how we began our two months stay in this incredibly beautiful place, in Patagonia. What an amazing summer! Oh Lord, how I miss this place!</div>
<p />
<div>
<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8708.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></p>
<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama3.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8423.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8835.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8635.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></p>
</div>
<p />
<div><strong>But that wasn&#8217;t enough</strong></div>
<p />
<div>When things finally settled down I began to read a few books that were waiting for my attention for a while. Two of them were about traveling. But not so much traveling as in tourism. Just traveling as in traveling. And them I came across this idea of traveling permanently. Like living in different parts of the world and never actually stoping in any place in a permanent way.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I confess that when we left Brazil this was something that I didn&#8217;t think about. But then, reading the books, I realized that we had all of the necessary pre-requisites. Being a person that loves traveling myself, this obviously appealed to me. Next thing you know, I was asking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>: what if we traveled all the time instead of just living in Argentina? I mean, we both love Argentina. But we could also live in other places. Fortunately, she once more agreed with my crazy idea. :-)</div>
<p />
<div>By the way, the books in question are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325243644&amp;sr=8-1">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Non-Conformity-Rules-Change-World/dp/0399536108/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325243661&amp;sr=8-1">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want,&nbsp;and Change the World</a>. The later was the one I liked the most, as a matter of fact, although it&#8217;s not strictly about traveling. Chris and I have many similar points of view on how we should live our lives.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_1768pb.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2196.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3199.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div><strong>Beyond the original plan</strong></div>
<p />
<div>To test this idea, we booked a trip to Europe to take place by the end of our stay in Bariloche. Hence, in March. There we visited Spain, the South of France, Monaco and Italy. Always balancing some work, some level of sightseeing and a lot of delicious food tasting, which one can tell easily from my current shape. Oh, I&#8217;m in shape! Round is a shape, isn&#8217;t it? :D</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8420.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_0996.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_1178.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2729.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8451.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div>With this great start, we later spent some well anticipated time in Buenos Aires, followed by really cool travels to Colombia, Venezuela, Cura&ccedil;ao, Uruguay, Chile and more recently Australia and New Zealand where we are now. In total, we&#8217;ve been to twelve countries in three different continents, and also to many beautiful parts of Brazil. Specially Jericoacoara and Ta&iacute;ba. And we still managed to keep up with the work. Not bad at all.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>And, before I forget, let me tell you something. Of course we liked each place we visited. But I must say that South America is just so incredibly cool. It was so much fun to visit our neighbors. My only regret is that it took me so long to do it. Man, what a bunch of amazing countries and what a lovely people. Can&#8217;t wait to come back!</div>
<p />
<div>In the process, we made lots of new friends, learned a ton about each place we&#8217;ve been to and had so many amazing experiences that would easily fill a book. And most importantly,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;took so many breathtaking pictures that it was really hard to choose just a few to illustrate this post.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3323.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3089.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3074.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3067.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2795.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2356.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2684.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_1744.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_1804.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2206.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
<p />
<div>One year later the only thing I can say is that we couldn&#8217;t have ask for more. This is just so much better that we could ever dream of. &nbsp;And the best part is that it&#8217;s only the beginning. We don&#8217;t plan to settle anytime soon.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>We&#8217;re still learning to live like that. We still make many mistakes. But that is part of the process. We miss our family and friends in Brazil, as much as we miss Brazil itself, but we keep on hoping that friends and family not only understand this rather strange way of living but might also get inspired to travel more and live unusual experiences themselves.</div>
<p />
<div>Do we have plans for 2012? Oh yeah! We have many more places to visit, much more nice people to meet and yet&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I will be spending enough time in Brazil as well, so that she can continue to do her brilliant work. But for now, we&#8217;ll still spend some more time here, in this part of this planet that we decided to take as our home, as a whole.</div>
<p />
<div>Wish you all an outstanding 2012. May you have some awesome journeys too!</div>

    <link href="http://viniciusteles.com/our-first-week-in-sydney-australia"/>
    <updated>2011-12-11T00:00:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/our-first-week-in-sydney-australia</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>We&#8217;ve been in Sydney for almost a week now. So it&#8217;s time to share a few more impressions.</div>
<p />
<div>I was supposed to say that Sydney is awesome and incredible. Well, it certainly is a nice and beautiful place, but maybe for us it&#8217;s just a bit too similar to other parts of the world we&#8217;ve been to.</div>
<p />
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/sydney_panorama.jpg" alt="Our first week in Sydney, Australia" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>UK and the USA</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I think it&#8217;s a common pattern for people to describe new places comparing them with others they&#8217;ve visited in the past. This, of course, gives us an inaccurate picture, but it&#8217;s just human nature. We can&#8217;t &nbsp;help it.</div>
<p />
<div>So the first days in Sydney felt as if we were in what I would loosely describe as a mix of the best parts of the USA and the UK. More precisely, it felt like a blend of San Francisco and London. Sydney has an outstanding public transport network based on trains, buses and ferries during the day. And nightly buses at night, when the trains are not operating anymore. Just like in London. The difference here is that trains are used, instead of the underground, as the subway is called in London.</div>
<p />
<div>The suburbs are similar to the ones in the London area and you&#8217;d drive your car on the left side of the streets, just like in the UK. But what&#8217;s different here, is that houses tend to be much bigger which reminds us of the suburbs of several American cities.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>The area around the harbor also reminds me of San Francisco. There, the Golden Gate Bridge is the main landmark, while here this role is played by the Harbour bridge.</div>
<p />
<div>But as I said before, it looks like a mix of the best aspects of both cities. The trains are cleaner than the London underground trains and they&#8217;ve got much more seats. They&#8217;re certainly less crowded two.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Sydney is a city that received many immigrants in the past. So, walking around or taking the trains, we often see people from different origins. And we&#8217;re often listening to languages that we can&#8217;t understand. There are many Asians, for instance, and we always wonder: what language are they speaking? This multicultural scene is something that we really appreciate, and it&#8217;s one more thing that reminds us of cities like London and New York, for instance.</div>
<p />
<div>Poverty or misery still haven&#8217;t shown their face to us in Sydney.&nbsp;We saw just one person begging in CBD (Sydney downtown) while in San Francisco there are lot&#8217;s of people begging in downtown as well as in London.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Weather</strong></div>
<p />
<div>To be honest, we haven&#8217;t had luck with the weather so far. Except for yesterday, when we&#8217;ve have a bright sunny morning, the rest of the days have been quite rainy. I know that this can have a huge effect on our impressions. After all, rain just plain sucks. It hinders your ability to move around and explore the city properly, specially in Sydney, where the best attractions are outside, like in Rio. So this could very well explain why the city still didn&#8217;t captivate us.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Different habits</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Sydney seems to be a city that welcomes daytime outdoor activities. It&#8217;s mostly closed for business at night, with a few exceptions, of course. The thing is that Patricia and I are night people. We like to sleep late and we love cities where we can walk at night and find people doing the same, enjoying restaurants and all kinds of conveniences overnight. So, Sydney isn&#8217;t a great match. But I have to admit that most cities in the world probably operate more like the way Sydney does, than the way we appreciate the most. That&#8217;s probably why we like Buenos Aires so much. The nightlife there is extremely rich, which is a very welcome feature for people like us. :-)</div>
<p />
<div>I should add that shops close really early in Sydney, as far as we could seen. Just to give a quick example, last Saturday we&#8217;ve been to a shopping mall in the suburbs, near the house we&#8217;re staying in. It&#8217;s a big shopping mall with many excellent stores, supermarkets, restaurants and all kinds of conveniences. To our surprise, it closed by 6 PM. This is really early for us! :-)</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Party</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Last Friday our good friends, Fabio and Camila, hosted a pre-Christmas Party and invited us. Thank you, Fabio! :-)</div>
<p />
<div>We had a great time with them and their friends from different parts of the world. Enif, one of their friends, is an amazing cook. So she prepared a delicious meal that was very much appreciated by everyone. Them we had a secret Santa gift exchange, which was a lot of fun!</div>
<p />
<div>At some point Patricia and I were exhausted. Maybe we were finally feeling the effects of the jet lag. At 2 AM we just couldn&#8217;t cope anymore. The thing was: how to get back home?</div>
<p />
<div>We use the train to come back home and, as far as we know, trains just stop working during the night. A little bit before midnight, we checked to see the time of the last train. And the information we got made us believe that trains would be working all night long every hour. So we relaxed. Later, when we were really tired, we checked again and found that actually, trains really stopped operating and we&#8217;d only be able to use the night bus. When we checked before, we misinterpreted the information.</div>
<p />
<div>Theoretically, night buses are fine. But, the journey is longer and we&#8217;d have to learn how to use them at a time when we were already very tired. Fortunately, Juliana, one of Fabio and Camila&#8217;s friends, had a car and lived not far from the place we&#8217;re staying in. So she offered to bring us to a place near and we caught a taxi to cover the last miles. She can&#8217;t imagine how much we appreciated that. It really helped a lot in a moment when we were just incredibly tired. Thank you so much, Juliana!</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Planning</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I wrote about this because it&#8217;s something that raised my attention to something very important during our trips: planning. We wouldn&#8217;t have had any trouble coming back home if I had checked the train timetable before even going to the party. I had the timetable with me all of the time. So I just needed to check it and we&#8217;d have been much better of. Why didn&#8217;t I do that?</div>
<p />
<div>After observing people from other parts of the world, I came to realize that Brazilians are not very used to plan. Or at least, tend not to plan as much or as thoroughly as other people. I guess that is one the reasons why we&#8217;re always late. And many times, very late! :-)</div>
<p />
<div>This is an area where I&#8217;ve been improving a lot over the years, but there&#8217;s still a long way to go. Planning is essential for our trips and I certainly do a lot of planning before the trips. But it&#8217;s still very hard to me to plan the little details of a specific day. So deciding what to do tomorrow, what time to leave home, what time to do this or that, which time to take the train back etc is just very unnatural to me as a Brazilian. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m still struggling with and hopefully I&#8217;ll get better at. I just need to and I&#8217;ll use a quick anecdote to explain why.</div>
<p />
<div>We have some friends in Switzerland that we visited several times. And one thing that always called my attention there is how they planned everyday so carefully. During breakfast, the family would always discuss briefly the plans for the day, with precise hours for each activity. For instance, at 9 AM we&#8217;ll leave for a hiking followed by a picnic. Then we should be back at 11:45h and have lunch at 12:15h. At 2 PM we&#8217;ll visit the lake, have some snacks around 4:30 PM and be back home at 7 PM for dinner.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>This kind of planning would happen briefly every morning. And it felt really strange for us as Brazilians. But you know what? By the end of the day, everybody managed to do a lot and have a good time, because things were well planned. It felt too rigorous for us at first, but the end result was excellent. So eventually I understood that this was actually a very good practice and I&#8217;ve been trying to apply it ever since. Unfortunately, though, I still have a long way to master it.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Next weeks</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Speaking of planning, we&#8217;re now trying to decide what to do on the next weeks. Unfortunately, it isn&#8217;t that easy.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>To the North, there are great beaches and the Great Barrier Reef. But I have to admit that we&#8217;re not very attracted by them. We&#8217;re very used to beaches and we&#8217;ve been to some amazing beaches in Brazil and the Caribbean throughout this year. So that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re looking for now. Besides, going to those places and diving on the Great Barrier Reef we&#8217;ll certainly prove to be a beautiful experience but also a quite expensive one. Since we still have a lot to cover in this trip and other countries ahead of us, we&#8217;re preferring not to spend so much now on something that is, to some extend, more of the same.</div>
<p />
<div>Besides, finding reasonably priced places to stay where we can balance a bit of tourism and work is really hard. Specially because internet access in Australia is often offered with some serious restrictions that are often deal breakers for us. As a matter of fact, this is something that I really really didn&#8217;t like at all about Australia. The way internet access if offered here is awful. But, I also have to admit that I already knew that.</div>
<p />
<div>Going to the outback would be interesting, because it would really be a different experience. But, this is certainly not the right time of the year to do that. Visiting the desert during summer tends to be, well, too hot. And heat definitely doesn&#8217;t bring me a lot of happiness.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>So we&#8217;re probably heading south. We&#8217;ll probably move on to Melbourne and possibly visit some places nearby. The challenge now is to find accommodation, reasonably priced and with some serious internet access. By the way, have I told you how expensive this country is? On a positive note, people here are really nice and we feel very welcome everywhere we go. This is pretty awesome!</div>
<p />
<div>Finally, mind the fact that I&#8217;ve written this after spending the last three days trying very hard to decide what to do and where to go next, in a way that balances expenses, experiences, preferences and ability to work using a good internet connection. There are many options, there is a lot to do, and there are also some important constraints to pay attention to. It&#8217;s been a hard exercise so far. Hence, this write up might look a bit &nbsp;sour. Australia is a nice country for sure, we&#8217;re just still trying to find our way around.</div>
<p />
<div>Cheers, mate.</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I arrived in Sydney on Tuesday, 6th of December 2011.&nbsp;So let me share some of our first impressions.<p /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/vinicius-teles-in-sydney.jpg" alt="First impressions of Sydney, Australia" /><p /><strong>Flight</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />We took a Qantas non-stop flight in Buenos Aires, that lasted 14 hours and was much less painful than anticipated.&nbsp;The airplane flies over the shores of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>&nbsp;for quite a while. So we had the chance to see images of huge ice blocks floating on the ocean. It&#8217;s a very interesting view. But most of the time there was just that bright white all around us.</p>
<p />
<div>Before the flight I chose a good seat for us with the help of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seatguru.com/">SeatGuru</a>&nbsp;and I stocked a good selection of Argentinian movies in my iPad. So, in the end, the flight was actually comfortable and entertaining.&nbsp;<p />&nbsp;The plane left from Buenos Aires at around 1:30 PM (Buenos Aires local time) and arrived in Sydney at 5:30 PM (Sydney local time) on the following day. So it was daytime during the whole flight. &nbsp;The good news is that&nbsp;we arrive in Sydney in the beginning of the night. And since we&#8217;re tired, the natural thing to do is to sleep. So, we go to bed at the right time, in the new time zone. Which helps us adjust and avoid jet leg. So far, we hadn&#8217;t&nbsp;felt any jet leg at all.
<div>
<div>&nbsp;<br /><strong>Bed and breakfast</strong><p />We chose this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/220869">bed and breakfast in the suburbs of Sydney</a>.&nbsp;The place is absolutely excellent and the price was quite affordable, in a city where accommodation is often very expensive. Arriving here from the airport is easy by train, although it takes a while (one hour).<p />&nbsp;<strong>Transport</strong><p />Sydney has an excellent railway system, with several lines and trains coming and going frequently. And it is also possible to buy multi day passes, which reduces the expenses significantly. We bought a 7 days pass that&nbsp;not only allows us to take trains, but also buses and ferries. It costed AUS 48 each.<p />&nbsp;<strong>Visiting the city</strong><p />For staters, we went to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/">Opera House</a>, one of the most well known landmarks of Sydney. It&#8217;s a beautiful place, of course, with great views to the bay and the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge">Harbor Bridge</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/">Botanical Gardens</a>&nbsp;are just beside, so we&nbsp;spent some time there as well. It&#8217;s a large and beautiful park.<p />&nbsp;<strong>CBD</strong><p />Next we decided to stroll around CBD, or Central Business District, which is basically Sydney&#8217;s downtown. It has a cool and futuristic skyline and, of course lot&#8217;s of office buildings and stores. But one interesting thing&nbsp;about it is that we saw not only people wearing suites, but also lots of them wearing sports outfits. Since CBD is close to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/">Botanical Gardens</a>, a place where many people come to exercise, we often see lots of the&nbsp;exercising mates walking around CBD, which creates a rather interesting contrast.<p />&nbsp;<strong>Internet</strong><p />While we were in CBD, we tried to find some free WIFI. Unfortunately, no luck there. There was free access at the Circular Quay train station and that was it. We couldn&#8217;t find any other consistent free WIFI hotspot around&nbsp;CBD. No coffee shops seemed to offer it, or any other kind of place. Actually we saw a McDonald&#8217;s that supposedly offered it, but no luck when we tried to connect. So, we realized that reports from previous travelers&nbsp;about this subject seem to be on spot. Sydney and free WIFI still don&#8217;t know each other very well.&nbsp;<p />&nbsp;Later, talking to our friend,&nbsp;<a href="http://fabiopereira.me/">Fabio Pereira</a>, we learned that internet connection is most commonly offered in Sydney with a limited amount of gigabytes for download and upload. I&#8217;m not only talking about 3G. It also applies&nbsp;to the ADSL connections and any other kind of internet connection around here, so it seems. For us it&#8217;s like coming back in time one decade or more. It&#8217;s weird. But it also helps to explain why establishments in general&nbsp;won&#8217;t offer free internet connection. Besides, it&#8217;s kind of expensive.&nbsp;<a href="http://fabiopereira.me/">Fabio</a>&nbsp;told us that this probably happens because of the monopoly that takes place in the telecommunication sector.&nbsp;<p />&nbsp;Anyway, please understand that these are just first impressions. As such, they&#8217;re probably not accurate at all. Over the next days we&#8217;ll hopefully have a clearer picture. I just decided to mention it because internet access&nbsp;is quite crucial in general and more so for travelers and people working remotely.</div>
</div>
<div>Just one last curious fact while on this topic. The fastest internet connection I&#8217;ve ever used in my life was offered for free by a hotel in Medell&iacute;n, Colombia. &nbsp;Surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t in a developed country.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Fabio&nbsp;and&nbsp;ThoughtWorks</strong><p />By the end of the day we finally met our good friend&nbsp;<a href="http://fabiopereira.me/">Fabio</a>&nbsp;and we paid a quick visit to the nice&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>&nbsp;office here in Sydney, where he works, followed by a visit to his house and, of course, some pizza. :-)<p />&nbsp;It was really really good to see&nbsp;<a href="http://fabiopereira.me/">Fabio</a>&nbsp;again. And we&#8217;re looking forward to spend more time with him in the next days.</div>
