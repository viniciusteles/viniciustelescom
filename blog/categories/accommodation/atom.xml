    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recorded a couple of experimental podcast episodes this week and they worked fine. So, today I'm officially launching a new podcast. It doesn't have a name yet. But I'll probably come up with one down the road.</p>

<p>This podcast isn't on iTunes yet, but hopefully it will be in the near future. For now, the easiest way to follow is to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ViniciusTelesEN">subscribe to this blog's RSS feed</a>.</p>

<p>In this first official episode I introduce myself briefly and talk about our decision to not have a house anywhere in the world. Since it's kind of a controversial choice, I invite you to listen and think about this theme.</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/vinicius-teles/nomad-temporary-apartment">Play it directly on SoundCloud</a> if you prefer.</p>

<p>In this episode I mentioned a commencement speech by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> called <strong>This is water</strong>. I heard about it in <a href="http://www.tropicalmba.com/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water">this episode of the TropicalMBA</a>. I highly recommend you to listen to it below. It's absolutely great!</p>
