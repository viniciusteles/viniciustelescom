    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/freedom.jpg" alt="How important is freedom for software developers?" /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Photo by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndrake45/6201369535/">John Drake</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/deed.en">CC</a>).</span></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>This conversation took place several times in the last few days:</p>


<p>- So, how long are you staying in Istanbul.</p>


<p>- Two month.</p>


<p>- Wow, two months! Why? What are you doing in here? Work or something?</p>


<p>- Actually, it's kind of complicated. We don't have a house anywhere in the world. We keep traveling from one place to the other. This time we chose to spend two months in Istanbul and we're mostly working remotely for our businesses in Brazil.</p>


<p>- How cool is that? But what do you do?</p>


<p>- I'm a software developer. I just need my notebook and an internet connection, so it doesn't matter where I am in the world.</p>


<p>- Wow, what a privilege! I'm so jealous of you. Your profession is really great cause you can work from anywhere. That's amazing. And where do you go next?</p>


<p>- I still don't know. We haven't decided yet.</p>


<p>I have mixed feelings every time this conversation strikes. It's good to be reminded of the privilege I have as a software developer to work from anywhere in the world. It's not good to be reminded that many others have the same privilege but waste it somehow.&nbsp;</p>


<p>There are many software developers out there. Just a few understand this privilege and actually take action on it. Why? Pay attention to the two stories below.</p>


<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Renato: the conventional guy</span></strong></p>


<p>Let me describe a scenario that happens often in Brazil, cause it's the one I'm most familiarized with, but I suspect it isn't that different from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Renato is a guy who just got accepted at a good public university. He doesn't have to pay for his education and he'll be spending the next four years on a computer science course.</p>


<p>At the end of the first year internship offers begin to arrive. Soon he's working part time on some company and earning a very reasonable salary, for a student. It doesn't take long for him to come up with a brilliant idea: buying a car. He saves enough for the down payment and purchases what might not be a Ferrari, but is a respectable machine.</p>


<p>University is over and Renato is hired at one of the many companies desperately in need of a software developer. He's still in the beginning of his career, but now he has a very decent salary for someone at the bottom of the corporate ladder. An inevitable idea strikes him: I should probably buy my own place. After all, what else is more important than owning a house?</p>


<p>He saves enough for the down payment and buys a house, which doesn't really goes well with the old car. So he switches to a brand new one using the previous as down payment. Now he has two debts that will eat most of his salary for many years to come. But that's fine, because his salary will increase soon enough. He'll work his way out of programming, cause programming is kind of an entry level activity, so he thinks. He wants to become some sort of technical leader, business analyst or eventually a manager.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Life is better now, not only because of his shiny car and place, but also because he met the girl of his life. They date for a while and eventually decide to get married. Of course there has to be a wedding. Which means some serious expenses on the horizon.</p>


<p>Now Renato is married. He takes care of the payments of the car, the house and some wedding services that are being paid in installments. The moment he and his wife comes back from the honey moon is celebrated among the family with pestering questions on a very sure and specific topic: when will the baby come? A couple needs a baby for sure. At least one for starters.</p>


<p>They've been married for a couple of years now and his baby is about to born. No problem, cause at this point Renato is not a programmer anymore. He's making more money working on a managerial position. He fires emails, elaborates spreadsheets and files reports like no other. Great use of his time at the public university indeed.</p>


<p>Renato still has a few more years to become thirty. And at this point he's anything but free. He's bright, well educated, makes a lot of money but can't afford to change his life in any direction because he has too many responsibilities and lots of strings attached.</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Silvio: the crazy guy</strong></span></p>


<p>Now let's take a look at one of Renato's classmates. His name is Silvio and he lives with his family when he starts the computer science course. Same as Renato, actually.</p>


<p>In the first week at the university, Silvio, Renato and a few other colleagues are having lunch when they hear about <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a> for the first time. Renato doesn't give it too much attention. Silvio, on the other hand, decides to investigate it further. He learns, among other things, that many people host foreign travelers in order to improve their English conversation. Actually he needs to improve his own English skills, so he checks with his parents if it would be ok to share the apartment's couch with some foreigners. Fortunately, he gets green light.</p>


<p>Silvio receives his first guest from Toronto, Canada, few days later and realizes how poor his English skills are. But things go well. After a few days, he's more confident speaking in English with his guest. He feels like he's learned much more than in the six years he spent on a private English course.</p>


<p>Life goes on and he hosts several other people, always struggling to balance the time he spends with the guests and the time he needs to study for the university. Good thing is that this arrangement proved to be so challenging that he had to learn fast to focus and prioritize. And since his English skills improved so fast in a few months, he manages to find an internship position even earlier than Renato. Six months earlier to be more specific.</p>


<p>By the end of the first year at the university, Silvio has hosted dozens of people and most of them invited him to visit them in their hometown. &nbsp;Silvio makes a good money from the internship, but he saves most of it. Since he lives with his parents, he figures out that there's no hurry to spend the money, and it's always a good idea to have some cash saved for a rainy day.</p>


<p>Jorge is an Argentinian guest that became very close to Silvio. He insists that Silvio come to visit him during his vacations from the university. The flight ticket is not that expensive. So Silvio figures out that he can buy it without hurting his savings too badly. And since he'll stay at Jorge's place, for free, he decides to go.&nbsp;</p>


<p>He falls in love with Argentina and begin to learn Spanish with Jorge and his friends. One of them is also a software developer and he's involved in this cool open source software project. Silvio can't really program that well yet, but he is invited for the project and gets really enthusiastic about it.</p>


<p>Back home, Silvio keeps studying, hosting travelers and working. But he has a better internship position now, thanks to the skills he's been developing while he works in the open source project, and his ability to both speak English fluently and some Spanish. He makes even more money than before, but he keeps saving, most of the time. He doesn't have a car, but he doesn't have a debt either.</p>


<p>When the university comes to an end Silvio has already traveled to over thirty different countries. Most of the time visiting people he hosted before. He has lots of friends all over the globe. Not only because of <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a>, but also thanks to the work he's been doing on some open source projects.</p>


<p>In fact, precisely because of this work, he's now receiving offers from many companies and some of them pay really well. He chooses one and go for it. It's kind of far from his home, it will take him a lot of time commuting, but the work seems to be pretty cool.</p>


<p>Few months latter he's really sick of the commuting. And at this point he feels like it's about time to move out of his parents house. So he finds this small apartment close to his work. He has a very good salary and already has substantial savings for a nineteen year old kid. Which is kind of funny if you think that he already traveled to so many countries. But always on the cheap, thanks to his friends.</p>


<p>He rents the small flat and makes sure to have a couch to keep hosting travelers. Since it's just five minutes away from his work, there's no need to have a car. Sometimes he likes to travel by car to places not too far away, so he rents a car only for the necessary period, since this is much cheaper than actually owning a car.</p>


<p>Two years later he get's this incredible job offer. But unfortunately in a place too far away, on the other side of the city. After some thought he realizes he can just move to another apartment, closer to the new workplace. Since he doesn't own his current apartment, he doesn't have any debt nor any kind of attachments to it, he's free to move out in no time.</p>


<p>Few years goes by and he keeps traveling a lot and enjoying the <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/travel-with-local-guide.html">help and hospitality of local people</a>, always using a bit of his savings and saving even more staying with one of the many friends spread over the globe. And because he's a software developer, a programmer that only gets better over time, he's really respected in his company. So his boss is very accommodating when he wants to travel for a longer period of time and asks to do his work remotely.</p>


<p>One day he's traveling in South Korea when he meets Daniela, the girl of his life. She's a Brazilian fashion designer spending her vacations in South Korea and Japan, both paradises for fashion designers. Inspirations everywhere.</p>


<p>It turns out that Daniela is not only Brazilian. She actually comes from the exact city where Silvio lives, but they've never met there. How crazy is life? They met for the first time thousands of miles away from their hometown. They eventually begin to date as soon as they come back to Brazil.</p>


<p>A while later they decide to get married. But since both love to travel, they prefer to save money for that and actually avoid high expenses from a wedding. So they organized a nice wedding, but nothing too big nor too fancy. Most importantly, they don't want to have any kind of debt after the wedding.</p>


<p>By the way, they still don't want to own a house and go into any kind of debt. So they rent another apartment, halfway to his and her job. It's not fancy nor big, but it's cozy and they like it.</p>


<p>Sometimes they travel together for longer periods and she also manages to convince her boss to work remotely in these occasions, which after a while became more and more frequent. Until a moment when both convinced their respective bosses that it would be just more productive to work from home.</p>


<p>They begin to work from home and spend much more time together. But now they ran out of excuses. When friends from other countries invite them for a visit, they can't say anymore that they won't be going because of work. Everyone knows they can work from anywhere. Poor guys, next thing you know they're traveling the world full time, cause it really doesn't matter where they are. They can still work and live a perfectly wonderful life hoping from country to country. They even decide to not have any house, anywhere in the world. And they move around sometimes using <a href="http://www.casalpartiu.com/2013/01/couch-surfing.html">Couch Surfing</a>, other times using <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/tell-a-friend?airef=283vz9905czz5">Airbnb to find affordable accommodation</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Seven years after the wedding they decide to have a kid. They think it's a good idea to come back to Brazil for a while and so they do it.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Life is different now. They rent a big enough apartment and don't travel all the time anymore. Specially in the first months of the new born. But it doesn't take long for the baby to join the party and begin to travel with them. After all, there are friends all over the world longing to meet little Lucas.</p>


<p>When it comes to buying a house, Silvio and Daniela didn't make up their minds yet. They don't even know where they'd like to spend the rest of their lives. But that's ok, by the time they decide it their savings will be more than enough to buy a house at sight with a good discount.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In the meantime, they're free to do be wherever they want, whenever they want, and still get their job done. How cool is that?</p>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Freedom to choose what to do with your own time</strong></span></p>


<p>Money is quite obvious. Everybody works for it. But time is what really matters, cause you can always make more money, but you can never get back the time that past. So I'd claim that one of the most important things in life is freedom to use time however you'd like.</p>


<p>There are many ways to achieve this freedom, specially if you are a software developer. You only need to pay attention at the decisions along the way. Also because life is too short to not pay attention.</p>


<p>So, what's going to be your story? Conventional? Crazy? Start paying attention.</p>

    <updated>2012-11-22T00:00:00-02:00</updated>
    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/digital-nomad-effects-on-productivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">digital nomads</a> a couple of years ago. We've been to dozens of cities and countries along the way. But it's not only leisure. As a matter of fact, we're working most of the time, regardless of our current location.</p>


<p />
<div>Working as we travel is quite challenging. But only recently I realized that it's essentially as challenging as before. Not worse. Nor better. Basically the same problem. Kind of counterintuitive, right?</div>
<p />
<div>When I had a home and a fancy home office, I struggled to get work done. I worked a lot and I was always busy. But producing meaningful results and getting close to achieving my goals was an entirely different story. It's easier to be busy than to make progress.</div>
<p />
<div>I've always had many to do lists, each one with zillions of entries. So many things in fact, that it's hard to choose from. What's the most meaningful tasks to accomplish today? This week? This month?</div>
<p />
<div>I'd eventually choose one, but my days would go filled with all sorts of distractions. By the way, distractions are so plentiful and so addictive these days, that it's hard to believe we can ever ship anything at all. I've got to admit that email, Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, the news website, just to mention a few, are a drag. I try to fight them as much as possible, but they keep coming back and sucking the life out of me. And it could be worse. I don't watch TV at all. What if I did?</div>
<p />
<div>When I was at my home office, other mundane distractions took a lot of my time too. Some things really needed to be done and would take time that I'd rather put in my work. But many others could be completely avoided.</div>
<p />
<div>While traveling I noticed that the pattern has changed but the results were the same. Instead of dealing with trivial distractions, I have to act on some serious topics every day. Like, where are we going to spend the night? How do we move from the airport to our temporary apartment when we get to this new city tomorrow? By the way, where is the best place to stay in this city? Which country are we going to visit next month?&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>When it comes to traveling,&nbsp;<a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I have very clear responsibilities. She takes the pictures, I organize the trip. So I really have to research and decide on a wide variety of topics almost every day. It's a lot of work and it takes time.</div>
<p />
<div>So, as before, I can't be as productive on my work as I wish. It used to be caused by trivial distractions. Now it's caused by some seriously basic needs. But as far work productivity is concerned, the end result is still the same: I get much less done than I'd like to admit.</div>
<p />
<div>I've been thinking a lot about this lately and I have a theory. I believe there's a way to solve this problem and have more work done using a somewhat counterintuitive idea. What if I'd choose to dedicate my workday to execute <strong>one and only one task</strong> and actually finish it in one day, no matter what happens during the day?&nbsp;</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since the last post. That's because I made a mistake. I wrote the first articles with a lot of care and illustrated them with some amazing pictures from Pati. I can do this once in a while, but I just can't do this every day. It would be just too much work. <p /> So I'm just writing today to take the pressure off. From now on I'll make a daily effort to write a little bit about our journey. Just enough to update you. I think it's going to be better to have several small posts over time than a few elaborated ones that are seldom published. <p /> Since my last writing, when we were in Australia, we visited several places. We went to New Zealand, Japan, India and Thailand. At this moment we're in Malaysia. Both Japan and Thailand are places that we plan to come back often from now on. We loved them!</p>

    <id>http://viniciusteles.com/why-live-in-a-country-when-you-can-live-in-a</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exactly one year ago&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I left Brazil to begin a new life in another country: our beloved Argentina. At least that was the plan, but what actually happened was something else that we could never anticipate.</p>


<div><br />
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_0483.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>The idea</strong></div>
<p />
<div>In 2009, after a lovely trip to Buenos Aires I had this "crazy" idea: what if we moved to Buenos Aires? I suggested that to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and she happily agreed that this would be really cool. The only problem is that this couldn't happen any time soon.</div>
<p />
<div>You see,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;is a renowned&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">wedding photographer in Brazil</a>. So, although it was still 2009, she was already heavily booked for 2010. Meaning she would be taking pictures of weddings almost every weekend during 2010. So, the only thing we could do was to push the move to the end of 2010. And so we did it.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/blog_madrid_0020.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC0103.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC0061.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Experiments</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, by that time, she still had some room in the first months of the year. So we managed to squeeze a trip around the USA in the beginning of 2010. &nbsp;That gave us an opportunity to experiment with remote working.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;works with Karol and I work with Leandro. They would both stay in Brazil during this USA trip and we'd be forced to work with them remotely.</div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, everything went well and we found the confidence to go on with our plans. So&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;worked her schedule of 2011 in a way that would allow less weddings and more time between each of them. This way, we'd be able to move to Argentina but still come back to Rio from time to time, so that she could take picture of weddings there. In my case, since my work could be accomplished remotely, I'd be just fine anywhere as long as there would be internet connection available.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC7657.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama1.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama2.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div><strong>The preparation</strong></div>
<p />
<div>The last months of 2010 were just crazy as we tried to prepare for the move. The major effort was to sell everything we had and clear the apartment. This proved to be a much harder endeavor than we could possibly anticipate. A kind of story that deserves many posts apart.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2755.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2750.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<p />
<div><strong>The beginning</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, on the 30th of December of 2010 we flew to Argentina. And just a couple of hours later we began to drive two thousand kilometers in order to arrive in beautiful Bariloche, just in time for New Years Eve. We arrived there exactly at 23:30h on the following day with no booking in any hotel. Yes, you can call me crazy. :-) But with the never ending list of pre-trip tasks, I couldn't take care of this. I was barely able to book a car rental.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, after asking in different hotels with no luck we managed to find a nice place to stay. And that's how we began our two months stay in this incredibly beautiful place, in Patagonia. What an amazing summer! Oh Lord, how I miss this place!</div>
<p />
<div>
<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8708.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></p>
<p><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/panorama3.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8423.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8835.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/_DSC8635.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></p>
</div>
<p />
<div><strong>But that wasn't enough</strong></div>
<p />
<div>When things finally settled down I began to read a few books that were waiting for my attention for a while. Two of them were about traveling. But not so much traveling as in tourism. Just traveling as in traveling. And them I came across this idea of traveling permanently. Like living in different parts of the world and never actually stoping in any place in a permanent way.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I confess that when we left Brazil this was something that I didn't think about. But then, reading the books, I realized that we had all of the necessary pre-requisites. Being a person that loves traveling myself, this obviously appealed to me. Next thing you know, I was asking&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>: what if we traveled all the time instead of just living in Argentina? I mean, we both love Argentina. But we could also live in other places. Fortunately, she once more agreed with my crazy idea. :-)</div>
<p />
<div>By the way, the books in question are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/0812992180/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325243644&amp;sr=8-1">Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Non-Conformity-Rules-Change-World/dp/0399536108/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325243661&amp;sr=8-1">The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want,&nbsp;and Change the World</a>. The later was the one I liked the most, as a matter of fact, although it's not strictly about traveling. Chris and I have many similar points of view on how we should live our lives.</div>
<div><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_1768pb.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_2196.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /><img src="http://viniciusteles.com/images/DSC_3199.jpg" alt="Why live in a country when you can live in a planet?" /></div>
<div><strong>Beyond the original plan</strong></div>
<p />
<div>To test this idea, we booked a trip to Europe to take place by the end of our stay in Bariloche. Hence, in March. There we visited Spain, the South of France, Monaco and Italy. Always balancing some work, some level of sightseeing and a lot of delicious food tasting, which one can tell easily from my current shape. Oh, I'm in shape! Round is a shape, isn't it? :D</div>

<div>With this great start, we later spent some well anticipated time in Buenos Aires, followed by really cool travels to Colombia, Venezuela, Cura&ccedil;ao, Uruguay, Chile and more recently Australia and New Zealand where we are now. In total, we've been to twelve countries in three different continents, and also to many beautiful parts of Brazil. Specially Jericoacoara and Ta&iacute;ba. And we still managed to keep up with the work. Not bad at all.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>And, before I forget, let me tell you something. Of course we liked each place we visited. But I must say that South America is just so incredibly cool. It was so much fun to visit our neighbors. My only regret is that it took me so long to do it. Man, what a bunch of amazing countries and what a lovely people. Can't wait to come back!</div>
<p />
<div>In the process, we made lots of new friends, learned a ton about each place we've been to and had so many amazing experiences that would easily fill a book. And most importantly,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;took so many breathtaking pictures that it was really hard to choose just a few to illustrate this post.</div>

<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
<p />
<div>One year later the only thing I can say is that we couldn't have ask for more. This is just so much better that we could ever dream of. &nbsp;And the best part is that it's only the beginning. We don't plan to settle anytime soon.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>We're still learning to live like that. We still make many mistakes. But that is part of the process. We miss our family and friends in Brazil, as much as we miss Brazil itself, but we keep on hoping that friends and family not only understand this rather strange way of living but might also get inspired to travel more and live unusual experiences themselves.</div>
<p />
<div>Do we have plans for 2012? Oh yeah! We have many more places to visit, much more nice people to meet and yet&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriciafigueira.com.br">Patricia</a>&nbsp;and I will be spending enough time in Brazil as well, so that she can continue to do her brilliant work. But for now, we'll still spend some more time here, in this part of this planet that we decided to take as our home, as a whole.</div>
<p />
<div>Wish you all an outstanding 2012. May you have some awesome journeys too!</div>
