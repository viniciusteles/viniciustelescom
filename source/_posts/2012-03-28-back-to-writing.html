<p>It's been a while since the last post. That's because I made a mistake. I wrote the first articles with a lot of care and illustrated them with some amazing pictures from Pati. I can do this once in a while, but I just can't do this every day. It would be just too much work. <p /> So I'm just writing today to take the pressure off. From now on I'll make a daily effort to write a little bit about our journey. Just enough to update you. I think it's going to be better to have several small posts over time than a few elaborated ones that are seldom published. <p /> Since my last writing, when we were in Australia, we visited several places. We went to New Zealand, Japan, India and Thailand. At this moment we're in Malaysia. Both Japan and Thailand are places that we plan to come back often from now on. We loved them!</p>
