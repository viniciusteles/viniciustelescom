title: "Nomad: why we live in a temporary apartment"
description: Most people live in a permanent place. Since we're nomads we don't have a permanent place. We live in temporary apartments around the globe. This is unconventional and people ask us why we don't have a permanent place.

I recorded a couple of experimental podcast episodes this week and they worked fine. So, today I'm officially launching a new podcast. It doesn't have a name yet. But I'll probably come up with one down the road. 

This podcast isn't on iTunes yet, but hopefully it will be in the near future. For now, the easiest way to follow is to [subscribe to this blog's RSS feed][rss].

In this first official episode I introduce myself briefly and talk about our decision to not have a house anywhere in the world. Since it's kind of a controversial choice, I invite you to listen and think about this theme.

In this episode I mentioned a commencement speech by [David Foster Wallace][1] called **This is water**. I highly recommend you to listen to it below. It's absolutely great!
